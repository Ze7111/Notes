## Chapter 1: Mathematical Modelling
### 1.1 Mathematical Modelling
- A `mathematical model` is a `simplification` of a real-world situation. They are used to make `predictions` about the real world.
- It is a representation of a real-world situation using mathematical concepts and language.
- Mathematical `models` are used to:
  - Describe the real-world situation
  - Predict the behaviour of the real-world situation
  - Explain the behaviour of the real-world situation

Advantages | Disadvantages
---|---
They are relatively quick and easy to make | They are often inaccurate as they are simplifications of the real-world situation
The help predictions to be made | The model may only work in certain situations

### 1.2 Designing a Model
- The process of designing a model involves:
  1) Identifying the real-world situation
  1) A model is devised
  1) Model is used to make predictions about the real-world situation
  1) Experimental data are collected from the real-world
  1) Comparing the predictions with the experimental data
  1) Statistical analysis is used to determine the accuracy of the model
  1) Model is `refined` if necessary

## Chapter 2: Measures of Location and Spread
### 2.1 Types of Data
- We collect in statistics. Variables associated with non-numerical data are called `qulatiative variables`. Variables associated with numerical data are called `quantitative variables`.
- The flow chart below shows the process of collecting data:
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Types of Data] --> B[Quantitative - Numerical Data];
    B --> D[Discrete Data - Specific values in a range];
    D --> F[Examples include: number of students in a class, number of cars in a car park];
    B --> E[Continuous Data - Any values in a range];
    E --> G[Examples include: height of a person, weight of a person];
    A --> C[Qualitative - Non-numerical Data];
    C --> H[Examples include favourite colour, favourite food];
```
- Floating point numbers are used to represent continuous data. They are numbers that have a decimal point in them.
- They can not be used to represent discrete data as they are not whole numbers.
- Large ammounts of data can be represented using a `frequency table`. This is a table that shows the number of times a value occurs in a set of data.
- Sample Frequency Table:
  
Shoe Size(x) | Number of Students(f)
--- | --- 
39 | 3 
40 | 17
41 | 29
42 | 34
43 | 12

- `The groups of data are called classes`. The `class midpoints` are the `midpoints` of the classes.
- To find the class midpoints, add the upper and lower limits of the class and divide by 2.
$$ \text{Class Midpoint} = \frac{\text{Upper Limit} + \text{Lower Limit}}{2} $$
- The `class boundaries` are the `upper and lower limits` of the classes.
- To find the class boundaries, add the class midpoint to the class width and divide by 2.
$$ \text{Class Boundary} = \text{Class Midpoint} \pm \frac{\text{Class Width}}{2} $$
