## Chapter 1: Mathematical Modelling
### 1.1 Mathematical Modelling
- A `mathematical model` is a `simplification` of a real-world situation. They are used to make `predictions` about the real world.
- It is a representation of a real-world situation using mathematical concepts and language.
- Mathematical `models` are used to:
  - Describe the real-world situation
  - Predict the behaviour of the real-world situation
  - Explain the behaviour of the real-world situation

Advantages | Disadvantages
---|---
They are relatively quick and easy to make | They are often inaccurate as they are simplifications of the real-world situation
The help predictions to be made | The model may only work in certain situations

### 1.2 Designing a Model
- The process of designing a model involves:
  1) Identifying the real-world situation
  1) A model is devised
  1) Model is used to make predictions about the real-world situation
  1) Experimental data are collected from the real-world
  1) Comparing the predictions with the experimental data
  1) Statistical analysis is used to determine the accuracy of the model
  1) Model is `refined` if necessary

## Chapter 2: Measures of Location and Spread
- We collect in statistics. Variables associated with non-numerical data are called `qulatiative variables`. Variables associated with numerical data are called `quantitative variables`.
- The flow chart below shows the process of collecting data:

    id1(Types of Data) --> id1(Quantitative (Numerical Data));
    id1(Types of Data) --> id1(Qualitative (Non-numerical Data));
    id1(Quantitative (Numerical Data)) --> id1(Discrete Data (Specific values in a range));
    id1(Quantitative (Numerical Data)) --> id1(Continuous Data (Any values in a range));
    id1(Discrete Data (Specific values in a range)) --> id1(Examples include: number of students in a class, number of cars in a car park);
    id1(Continuous Data (Any values in a range)) --> id1(Examples include: height of a person, weight of a person);
    id1(Qualitative (Non-numerical Data)) --> id1(Examples include favourite colour, favourite food);
```
